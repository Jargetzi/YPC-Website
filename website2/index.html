				<p>
					In the beginning of 2008 Odyssey International was operating as a premier 8(a) General 
					Construction Manager at Tobyhanna Army Depot, Tobyhanna PA.  Odyssey specialized in Task Order
					Contracts (TOC) procured by the government using sole source or direct award methods.  Due to 
					the small business size standard, Odyssey was forced to turn away multiple sole source projects.
					Whitney McBride was approached by the contracting officer at Tobyhanna to locate another 8(a) 
					small business to bring on base to work alongside Odyssey International. 
				</p>
				<p>
					At the time Paul Jason Lee was working as an intern to gain business experience in the Utah office
					for Odyssey International.  Paul (PJ) was working on close out project documentation and filing 
					submittals and certified payroll for completed Odyssey projects. PJ had expressed interest in 
					starting his own 8a company; he recognized the opportunity working with his father Paul Lee who 
					was currently employed by Odyssey and Whitney to capitalize on the extra work at Tobyhanna. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Whitney started mentoring PJ in 2009 and played a vital part in helping him acquire his 8a status.
					In November of 2009 PJ Lee's company, YPC, Inc was accepted into the 8(a) program. However not long
					after YPC was accepted into the 8a program Tobyhanna lost the majority of their funding and cut back
					on the sole source program that Odyssey was participating in, therefore for the first 3 years of 
					existence YPC did a very small amount of subcontractor work. YPC has participated as a subcontractor
					for Odyssey on several Tobyhanna projects and two small projects at Letterkenny Army Depot located 
					in Chambersburg, PA.

				<h2>YPC Experience</h2>
				<a href="javascript:void(0)"> <img src="close_icon.png" class="close_btn"/></a>
				<p>
					YPC has worked as a subcontractor to Odyssey International on three renovation projects at Tobyhanna 
					and two separate concrete and HVAC projects at Letterkenny Army Depot.  In order to be successful as 
					a General Contractor the experience of your Superintendents and Project Managers is crucial.  As YPC 
					begins to receive contracts/awards the need for experienced employees will become critical to their 
					success.
				</p>
				<img src="building.png" class="displayInfoImg"/>
				<p>
					Due to the recent construction slowdown, Odyssey International has been forced to reduce its overall
					work force. Many of the employees Odyssey has let go were experienced Project Managers and 
					Superintendents, all of which have worked in the Federal Construction realm for several years.  YPC 
					will be using many of Odyssey’s contacts and looking to obtain sole source contracts from many of the
					same locations where Odyssey has worked.
				</p>
				<p>
					This is a great benefit to YPC as they will be obtaining work in common Federal locations with access 
					to experienced employees who live in the surrounding area and also have several vetted subcontractors 
					to work with. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Recently Odyssey International has been selected and is currently working on two 5 year Job Order 
					Contracts (JOC).  One contract is located at Ft Drum, NY which is in its second award year and the
					other is located at Letterkenny Army Depot, PA which is in its first contract year. These contracts
					allow Odyssey to maintain a select group of employees on each site. The workloads on these contracts
					typically are not overbearing and are fairly predictable. This would allow YPC to hire two (full time)
					key Odyssey employees in critical business roles, Blaine Hoopes will oversee construction and Michael
					Tingey will oversee job costing. 
				</p>
				<p>
					YPC will hire its employees outright; there will be no leasing of employees or borrowing employees
					from other companies. Too often new small businesses or 8(a) companies look to large companies to 
					share employees. This often confuses the SBA and can affect the control and management of the projects.

					In the beginning of 2013 Whitney and PJ began to discuss Odyssey International’s graduation from the 
					8(a) program and the mentoring of YPC.   June 28th 2013 Odyssey graduated from the program.  During 
					the past 9 years in the 8a program Odyssey has developed critical relationships with the Contracting 
					Officers of the North Atlantic Division (NAD) this includes the Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York,
					New England and Norfolk district offices for the Corp of Engineers.  With the sole source 8(a) direct 
					award contracts no longer available to Odyssey International Whitney and PJ will combine efforts to 
					market YPC to many of the contacts that Odyssey has a relationships with.  With YPC’s acceptance into
					the 8a program in 2009,YPC is in a prime position to capture the sole source opportunities that Odyssey
					is no longer eligible for.
				</p>	
				<p>
					With Odyssey’s graduation from the 8a program, Whitney McBride can now work for or offer consulting 
					services to other 8a businesses. Whitney using her past performance from Odyssey and her numerous 
					contacts, will work closely with PJ in securing direct award and task order work for YPC.  In November,
					PJ and Whitney had the opportunity to go to Kansas City, MO for the National Small Business SAME 
					conference.  This was a huge opportunity for YPC.  We were able to spend one on one time with key people
					that can help and are willing to help YPC move forward.  We are currently pursuing relationships with 
					the North Atlantic Division and also the Albuquerque District, the LA District and several large and 
					small firms.

				<h2>YPC Short Term Goal</h2>
				<a href="javascript:void(0)"><img src="close_icon.png" class="close_btn"/></a>
				<p>
					With the contacts YPC has made to date we believe that YPC can do 1 million dollars in revenue over 
					the next 12 months of 2014. YPC has maneuvered itself into a position to pick up small direct award
					projects at familiar installations. Many of these small sole source jobs will require less than 3 
					subcontractors and sometimes only one subcontractor. Because of YPC’s ability to lean on Odyssey’s
					pool of responsible subcontractors, we will have the ability to receive a contract, submit a price 
					quickly, and turn the project around successfully. 
				</p>
				<p>
					YPC is opening a bona-fide office in Mesa, Arizona to further their relationships with Luke AFB and 
					the National Guard.  YPC is also moving its headquarters to Lititz, PA.  Lititz is central to all of
					the major areas of the North Atlantic Division (NAD) This will give YPC a much larger marketing area
					for federal work.
				</p>
				<p>
					In 2014 YPC is projecting 2-4 million in revenue. YPC will be focusing on direct award contracts and
					a small JOC or TOC contract to start. YPC will not be competitively bidding unrestricted projects,
					therefore this will reduce financial risks and allow YPC to be more profitable. At the end of 2014,
					YPC will have successfully completed 10-15 small projects, with positive CCAS reports and dependable
					Project Managers.  Because of this the district offices and installations will begin to look to YPC 
					as their preferred 8a contractor.

			<div id="longTermGoals" class ="displayInfo2">
				<h2>YPC Long Term Goal</h2>
				<a href="javascript:void(0)"><img src="close_icon.png" class="close_btn"/></a>
				<p>
					YPC has a unique focus in mind.  Unlike most 8(a) construction companies that are willing to dive right
					in regardless of capabilities or risk, YPC is looking at mastering the concept of low risk, low dollar,
					and quick turnaround.  This approach does not include bidding large projects, teaming with large 
					businesses, or bidding any project that is available.  
				</p>
				<p>
					Our mission will be to focus on the TOC-JOC (Task Order Contracts direct award and Job Order Contracts)
					and IDIQ (Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quality) contracts.  These contracts are profitable and because
					of the small number of subcontractors to perform the work, less work to manage.  These contracts are 
					typically very difficult to get awarded and take years to establish the required relationships with 
					Contracting Officers and Government Officials that award these types of projects.
